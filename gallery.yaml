  Our project is a rhythm game where notes, represented by rectangular tiles, fall downwards.
  When the notes fully overlap with the keys, the corresponding key (d, f, j, or k) should be pressed.
  Better timing of the key-press is rewarded with a higher score. For long notes, the key should be held
  down for the entire duration of the note. Additionally, there is music playing in the background, which
  can help the player with the timing and rhythm.
